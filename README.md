## Pizza delivery app projectP
### Pizzaria Nostra Nonna

This project was developed as a task for my graduation course. The idea was to create an aplication for a company in order to solve a need of a company, that could be a real or fictional one.
In the case the company is a fictional restaurant called "Nostra Nonna Pizzaria".

The basic scenario was that the company was a small business that wanted to expand it's services and star to offer also by delivery.

So the project is basically a pizza delivery app, in wich the user can create an account, log in, view the menu, select the products he wants, and perform the purchase.

The application uses the ionic and Angular frameworks for its implementation and Firebase's FireStore and FireAuth for database and authentication respectivelly.

Another feature provided (that I plan to improve more in the near future) is a exclusive entrypoint where the company's management can perform an exclusive login method in order to view all the client's orders being registered.

- Future features:

      - A screen in the admin section where the company can manage the menu editing, deleting or including new items.
      - A screen where the company can edit it's business information: Address, contacts, etc.


- Future fixes:

      - Include the client's address in the information of the purchase.
      - Overall improvement of the admin section.
